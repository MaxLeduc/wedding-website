    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Krystle and Max skype for a work project.</li>
      <li>Krystle goes to Montreal to train Max on how to use the RCC website.â€¨(Although in the weeks following, Max seems to call frequently for 'help' on posting things.)</li>
      <li>Max comes to Toronto for an all staff conference. By random chance, Krystle pulls Max's name for staff-wide secret santa and the two are thrown together again during an ice-breaker game where you need to find your match, Max is Peanut Butter and Krystle is Jelly.</li>
      <li>After having met only twice, Max gets on a plane to visit Krystle in Toronto during their time off. </li>
      <li>Krystle and Max start dating, but don't tell any of their colleagues. A pattern of sneaking out of the office with a suitcase to catch the train begins on both sides. One person hides it pretty well. One doesn't. (Guess which is which?)</li>
      <li>They take a trip together to California and drive up the coast to L.A. While on that trip, Krystle gets a call to interview for a job at McGill University.</li>
      <li>Krystle moves to Montreal.</li>
      <li>Max moves to Toronto.</li>
      <li>After three years together, Max proposes to Krystle in ____ park. (It's minus 8 degrees outside.)</li>
      <li>Krystle and Max get hitched.</li>
    </ul>
