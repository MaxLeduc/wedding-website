    <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
    <div className="grid">
      <div className="grid-1of3">
        <p>We're coming from out of town and we're not sure we can make it to Montrealâ€¦.</p>
        <p>We know that spending a weekend away can be hard to arrange and we totally understand. We feel blessed to have such wonderful family and friends all over the country and the last thing we want to do is create stress for anyone. If you can't make it, we would love to get together with you and celebrate another time. For those in the Kawartha Lakes region, Bonnie has a celebration in the works as well at their home.</p>

        <p>Can I bring the kids?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately no - our venue isn't very kid-friendly. Hotel Nelligan does offer a babysitting service we can help point you to if you're staying in the hotel.</p>

        <p>Is there parking at the venue?</p>
        <p>Sort of, but we advise heavily against driving to the venue. There is very limited parking in Old Montreal in general. There is valet parking available at Hotel Nelligan, but it's somewhat expensive. We suggest leaving your car at your home or accommodation. It's very easy to get around via the Montreal Metro or using an Uber taxi and will likely cost you less than paying for parking. It also means that you can enjoy the event without needing to worry about driving home. We want to make sure all of our guests get home safely and will happily confiscate your keys after one drink. Feel free to get in contact with us and we can advise you on your best options.</p>
